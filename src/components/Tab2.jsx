        Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey.
         Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black.
          The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones. 
        Young lions have light spotting on their coats that disappears as they grow.<FaRegFaceSmileWink />
